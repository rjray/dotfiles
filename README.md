# Dotfiles

This is my dot-files repository. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Some of this (particularly the install script and lesskeys file) taken from
Marcel Gr√ºnauer's repo (https://github.com/hanekomu/dotfiles).

Odds are good that this is of very little interest to anyone else.

## Spin-Offs

There are two other repos of mine that are spin-offs of this one. If you're
genuinely interested in this repo, then I suppose you may be interested in
them, as well:

*   [vim-config](https://github.com/rjray/vim-config)

    This is my [Vim](http://www.vim.org) configuration. It isn't that
    exciting right now, because I'm not really a Vim power-user. But I
    do use it in some places where I prefer it over emacs, so I am trying
    to become better with it.

*   [emacs-config](https://github.com/rjray/emacs-config)

    This is my [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) configuration.
    There is more here than there is in the Vim config, because I'm
    primarily an emacs user (probably about 80% of my text editing). I have
    over 20 years' worth of various tweaks and modifications in my emacs
    set-up, though I have recently done a large-scale overhaul of it and
    pruned out a lot of cruft I no longer used.

Both of these spin-off repos make use of git's
[submodule](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules) feature. I first
spun off the emacs configuration, largely using Jason Filsinger's blog post
["Emacs, Git, Business & Pleasure"](http://filsinger.me/workflow/emacs-git-business-and-pleasure/)
as a guide. I then followed suit with the Vim stuff.
