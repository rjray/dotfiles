    <a:documentation>
      
        The versionString type is applied to attributes that describe simple
        revision-number strings. It only supports dotted-decimal styled
        version numbers.

  <rng:define name="informationType">
    <a:documentation>
      
        An informationType is an open-ended container type that allows
        mixed-content which can include elements from other XML namespaces.
        This allows users to include Dublin Core metadata, XHTML tags, etc. as
        desired within the &lt;description&gt; and similar blocks. It also
        allows for open-ended extension of ChangeLogML with things such as
        source-control specification, etc.

          The source attribute, if present, is used to refer to any external
          resource that may be related to the contents of the block-element
          that has the attribute. The role or relevance of the reference is not
          specified or constrained. The value of the attribute must be a URI,
          but may be absolute, relative, or a reference to a fragment. The only
          restriction is that it be a valid URI.

  <rng:define name="descriptionType">
    <a:documentation>
      
        A descriptionType extends informationType to add a specific attribute,
        called "lang", that specifies the (human) language the text of the
        block is written in. This allows for a ChangeLog to have multiple
        versions of the same &lt;description&gt; block in differing languages,
        leaving it to processors of the document to choose which one to
        display.

              This attribute specifies the language in which the content of
              the &lt;description&gt; block is written. The value of the
              attribute should be a language code (generally two characters,
              possibly followed by an underscore and qualifying country-code
              when the language is used by several countries), and the
              default value is "en_US" (American English).

        The fileType definition is used for the &lt;file&gt; element, a part

        be referred to from multiple places.

            The &lt;description&gt; block is optional, and may occur multiple
            times in different languages (as with all instances of this tag).
            It is used to describe the function or role of the file, and would
            generally only be used the first time a file is introduced.

            This block is optional, and may occur only once. If present, it is
            used to introduce source-control information specific to the
            current file. This can be useful if some elements of the project
            are spread across different source-control systems.

    <rng:attribute name="path"><rng:data type="string">
      <a:documentation>
        
          This attribute provides the path-name of the file. In general, this
          will be a path that is relative to the base directory of the project
          itself, though there is no rule prohibiting absolute paths, or
          presuming that paths are relative to some other location.

      <a:documentation>
        
          An optional attribute, this indicates the revision, or version, of
          the file as it is being referred to in the current context. Some
          source-control systems (such as CVS) version files individually,
          while others (such as Subversion) version files in groups generally
          referred to as transactions.

          The value is restricted to one of the strings: ADD, CHANGE, DELETE,
          MOVE or RESTORE. The default value is CHANGE, which simply means
          the file was modified. The other labels represent the states at
          which a file was added to the project, deleted from the project,
          moved within the file-system, or restored from a deleted state.

  <rng:define name="changeType">
    <a:documentation>
      
        The changeType declaration is used to define the structure of the
        &lt;change&gt; blocks. Each such block describes a single change to
        the project; this change may affect only one file, or it may affect
        many files. What each change has in common, is that it requires the
        specification of one or more affected files, as well as a description
        of the change itself.
      
    </a:documentation>
    
      <rng:choice>
        <a:documentation>
          
            For specifying the files affected by the change, the document
            may use one of two options: &lt;file&gt; or &lt;fileset&gt;. If
            the change affects only one file, a single &lt;file&gt; may be
            used. Otherwise, multiple files must be contained within an
            enclosing &lt;fileset&gt;. A &lt;fileset&gt; containing exactly
            one &lt;file&gt; tag should be considered functionally equivalent
            to just the stand-alone &lt;file&gt; tag itself.
          
        </a:documentation>
        <rng:ref name="file"/>
          <a:documentation>
            
              When the change affects just one file, this element is used
              to specify and describe that file.

        <rng:element name="fileset">
          <a:documentation>
            
              A &lt;fileset&gt; is a container for one or more &lt;file&gt;
              tags, though it is more efficient to use a single &lt;file&gt;
              element if there is only one changed file. All files in the
              container are considered to be part of the same change, and in
              terms of source-control are regarded as having been committed
              to the repository at the same time.
            
          </a:documentation>

                <a:documentation>
                  
                    This block is optional, and may occur only once. If
                    present, it is used to introduce source-control
                    information specific to the fileset/change. As some
                    source-control systems (such as Subversion) handle groups
                    of changed files as a single transaction, it may be more
                    economical to specify source-control information at this
                    level rather than for each file within the child-element
                    &lt;fileset&gt; individually.

                    One or more &lt;file&gt; elements must be present, with
                    no limit on the number allowed. The structure of the
                    block is the same at this level as for a single,
                    stand-alone instance of &lt;file&gt;.

            Within the &lt;change&gt; block, a &lt;description&gt; element
            represents the description of the change, in a manner similar to
            the comments provided to source-control systems when files are
            committed.

    <rng:optional><rng:attribute name="author"><rng:data type="NMTOKEN">
      <a:documentation>
        
          An optional attribute, this allows specification of the author of
          the current change-set being described. This is useful if the whole
          of a change is credited to one committer, as opposed to specifying the
          same author for every file in the &lt;fileset&gt; block.

          The "date" attribute details when the change was submitted, committed

          by the XML Schema standard, which is the ISO 8601 format for dates and
          times. Although ISO 8601 allows strings that specify only the date or
          time portions, the value of this attribute must contain at least the

          must be unique across all "id" attributes in the document, and

        A change element defines one change within a release. The change itself

        The releaseType is the primary piece of information that a ChangeLogML
        file collects and organizes. A release contains an optional description
        and other informational blocks, followed by one or more change
        blocks. The release element is also the greatest user of attributes
        besides the file element. A releaseType instance must have at least a
        "version" attribute, uniquely identifying the release itself.
        Additionally, it must have a "date" attribute to specify the date the
        release was created.

          treated in the same way as the "id" attribute; uniqueness is managed
          as a function of the schema rather than the definition of the type of
          data it can contain. It is not restricted to numerals and periods, as

          The "date" attribute details when the release was made available,
          bundled, etc. It uses the "dateTime" data-format as defined by the
          XML Schema standard, which is the ISO 8601 format for dates and
          times. Although ISO 8601 allows strings that specify only the date or
          time portions, the value of this attribute must contain at least the
          date, if not a full specification.

          must be unique across all "id" attributes in the document, and
          must conform to the XML Schema definition of an identifier token.

        The release element details one release within the overall change-log
        itself. Because the release element has a required attribute that
        provides a time-stamp, releases may appear in any order within the
        change-log, since processors can sort the elements by their relative
        dates.

  <rng:define name="subprojectType">
    <a:documentation>
      
        The subprojectType is a way of allowing a project to express
        relationship to one or more sub-projects within itself, such that the
        sub-projects are able to have their own changelogs and release
        schedules. An instance of subprojectType may explicitly contain
        &lt;release&gt; blocks (that may or may not simply be replicated from
        the sub-project's own ChangeLogML), or it may use a facility such as
        XInclude (or m4 pre-processed, etc.) to dynamically include such blocks
        from the sub-project.

            The &lt;description&gt; block for a subprojectType instance is used
            to provide a summary of the sub-project, like an abstract or
